Shared yard with mature citrus trees (you'll never buy lemons again). We're open to dogs, but would like to meet them first, and make sure they're compatible with our very friendly dog. The location is great - we're right around the corner from precita park. It has all the cute-ness of Bernal, while having very easy access to 24th street. Easy street parking, and direct access to both 101 and 280. Only one block of hill, so great for bikers. Open houses will be available this weekend 2-3pm on Saturday and 2-4pm on Sunday.
