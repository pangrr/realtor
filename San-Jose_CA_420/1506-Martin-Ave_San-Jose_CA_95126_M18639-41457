Nice house in a great area, but this property needs work. Yes, you could live in it as it is, but it's better if it's fixed up. With some effort this could be a pretty little cottage. Or, it could be completely rebuilt into something gorgeous. Extra two-bed/one-bath structure in rear. Lot is 172 feet deep so there's tons of room for the possibilities. \r\n", "Other rooms": ["No Separate Family Room", "Den/Study/Office", "Basement - Partial", "Bedroom(s) on Main Level"], "Heating and Cooling": ["Wall Furnace", "Gas Heating", "None"], "Baths": "1 Full Bath", "Exterior and Lot Features": ["Grade - Level Lot", "Patio(s)", "Sprinkler(s) - Front"], "Sold Date": "on Nov 13, 2014", "Garage and Parking": ["Detached", "Garage: 2"], "Bedrooms": ["Number of Bedrooms: 2", "Ground Floor Bedroom"], "Style": "Ranch", "Building and Construction": ["Ranch", "Tile Flooring", "Laminate Flooring", "Carpet - Wall to Wall Flooring", "Vinyl/Linoleum Flooring", "Thermostat Controller", "Detached", "Wood Exterior", "Concrete Perimeter Foundation", "Composition Roof", "Building Height: 1"], "Property Type": "Single Family Home", "Lot Size": "7,650 Sq Ft Lot", "Interior Features": ["Window Covering(s)"], "Kitchen and Dining": ["Refrigerator (s)", "Oven Range", "Hookups - Gas", "Formal Dining Room", "No Informal Dining Room"], "Nearby Private Schools": [{"Name": "St Leo The Great School", "Distance": "0.7 mi", "Grade": "PK-8", "Student/Teacher Ratio": "17:1", "Rating": "igs-p-NA"}, {"Name": "Bellarmine College Prep School", "Distance": "1.8 mi", "Grade": "9-12", "Student/Teacher Ratio": "20:1", "Rating": "igs-p-NA"}, {"Name": "St Martin Of Tours School", "Distance": "1.9 mi", "Grade": "K-8", "Student/Teacher Ratio": "22:1", "Rating": "igs-p-NA"}, {"Name": "Sage Vista School", "Distance": "2.0 mi", "Grade": "1-5", "Rating": "igs-p-NA"}, {"Name": "Eitz Chaim Academy", "Distance": "2.2 mi", "Grade": "K-8", "Rating": "igs-p-NA"}], "Year Built": "1912", "Appliances": ["Dryer", "Washer"], "Other Property Info": ["MLS City Name: San Jose", "Santa Clara County", "County ID: 43", "Area: Central San Jose", "Cross Street: Park Avenue", "Directions: Meridian Avenue north to Park.
